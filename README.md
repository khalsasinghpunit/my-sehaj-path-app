# Sehaj Path App

A React Native mobile application designed to help users maintain a consistent habit of doing the Sehaj Path daily. The app provides a digital platform for tracking reading progress, managing multiple reading sessions, and maintaining reading streaks.

## 🎯 Project Overview

Sehaj Path is a traditional Sikh practice of reading the complete Guru Granth Sahib Ji (the holy scripture) over a period of time. This app digitizes this spiritual practice by providing:

- **Progress Tracking**: Monitor your reading progress through 1430 Angs 
- **Multiple Paths**: Manage multiple reading sessions simultaneously
- **Reading Analytics**: View completion dates, reading streaks, and progress statistics
- **Customizable Reading Experience**: Adjustable font sizes, reading formats, and navigation

## ✨ Features

### Core Features
- **Home Dashboard**: Overview of all reading paths with progress indicators
- **Reading Interface**: Clean, distraction-free reading experience with Gurbani text

### Reading Experience
- **Font Size Customization**: Adjustable text size for comfortable reading

- **Punjabi/English Numbers**: Toggle between Punjabi and English number formats
- **Auto-scroll**: Automated reading progression with pause/resume functionality
- **Swipe Navigation**: Gesture-based navigation between pages

### Data Management
